281. Design & Implement LRU Cache
Medium
Design a cache system that can store and retrieve a single key-value pair. 
The cache should have a fixed capacity and follow the principle of Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy. 
The system should allow efficient access to the most recently accessed key-value pair while ensuring that 
the cache does not exceed its capacity. Implement methods to insert a key-value pair, retrieve the value
associated with a given key, and handle cache evictions when the capacity is reached. Optimize the design 
for fast read and write operations.
