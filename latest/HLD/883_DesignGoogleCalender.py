Design a simplified version of Google Calendar, a widely used calendar service that allows users to schedule events,
 create reminders, and manage their time effectively. The system should support basic functionalities such as adding,
   updating, and deleting events. It should also handle overlapping events and provide views for daily, weekly, and 
   monthly schedules.
