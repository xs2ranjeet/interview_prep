Hard
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes with an edge connecting each pair of neighboring nodes in the sequence. There is a maximum of one appearance per node in the sequence. Keep in mind that the root is not required to be traversed by the path.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example:

          -10
           / \
          9  20
            /  \
          12    8
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,12,8]
Output: 40
Explanation: The optimal path is 12 -> 20 -> 8 with a path sum of 12 + 20 +8 = 40.
